            <h2>Narrative 1: Software Engineering and Design</h2>
            <p>The artifact I selected for this milestone is the Airgead Banking App, which I initially created during
                my CS 210: Programming Languages course. This application calculates financial growth based on user
                inputs such as the initial investment amount, monthly deposits, annual interest rate and the number of
                years. The app uses C++ and object-oriented programming principles to display results in a clear and
                organized way.
                <br><br>
                I chose this artifact for my ePortfolio because it demonstrates important skills in software engineering
                and design. The enhancements I made focused on improving the app's security and reliability. I added
                secure coding techniques like input validation and exception handling to ensure that the app could
                handle
                invalid inputs and unexpected errors without crashing or looping indefinitely. I also added checks to
                prevent overflow, underflow and infinity result issues, which could have caused inaccurate calculations.
                Additionally, I improved the rounding of numbers to ensure the financial calculations are displayed
                accurately.
                <br><br>
                The enhancements align well with the course outcomes. For Outcome 3, I designed specific solutions to
                problems like bad inputs and calculation errors, ensuring the program uses sound programming principles
                and effectively manages trade-offs. For Outcome 4, I implemented innovative and advanced coding
                techniques to enhance functionality. For Outcome 5, I anticipate potential issues, such as catching and
                managing errors, to demonstrate a security mindset that protects the program.
                <br><br>
                The process of enhancing this artifact taught me valuable lessons about secure coding and error
                management. I learned how to validate user inputs more effectively and how to handle errors in a way
                that improves both the program's stability and user experience. One of the challenges I faced was
                ensuring the app could detect and handle infinity conditions during calculations. Solving this required
                research and testing to find the best approach. Through this process, I improved my skills in designing
                software that is secure and efficient.

            <h2>Narrative 2: Algorithms and Data Structures</h2>
            <p>The artifact is a text-based game that simulates a player's movement through a Walmart store, where they
                must collect essential items to win while avoiding Karen, the enemy. It was originally created in Python
                as a project in my previous computer science course IT 140: Introduction to Scripting. The game uses a
                map-based system with different rooms and allows players to navigate using directional inputs.
                <br><br>
                I included this artifact in my ePortfolio because it showcases my skills in data structures and
                algorithms. The game originally used a dictionary-based map to storeroom connections, but I improved it
                by implementing a graph and stack structure using objects and linked references. This change made the
                program more efficient and structured. Additionally, I separated the game logic into different modules
                to improve organization and readability.
                <br><br>
                I successfully achieved Outcome 3 by improving the game's room navigation using a graph structure,
                making it easier to manage room connections. I also met Outcome 4 by implementing advanced techniques,
                such as using a stack for inventory management, which improved the game's functionality. Additionally, I
                completed Outcome 2 by updating the project documentation. I clearly explained how the graph structure
                and stack work in simple terms, making it easier for others to understand and use the code.
                <br><br>
                During this process, I learned the importance of using the right data structures for organizing
                information. Changing from a dictionary-based structure to a graph helped me understand how graphs can
                represent real-world connections, like rooms in a building. One of the biggest challenges was
                restructuring the existing code without breaking the game's logic. However, this experience helped me
                improve my problem-solving and debugging skills.

            <h2>Narrative 3: Databases</h2>
            <p>The artifact is the database implementation of the Airgead Banking App, originally created in CS 210.
                This application calculates financial growth based on user inputs like the initial investment, monthly
                deposits, interest rate, and years. The enhancement adds MySQL integration to store and retrieve user
                data, making the application more functional and realistic.
                <br><br>
                I included this artifact in my ePortfolio because it demonstrates my ability to integrate databases with
                a C++ application. The improved version allows user data to be stored and retrieved securely using
                MySQL. It also shows my understanding of modular programming, as I separated the database logic from the
                main application. The enhancements include database setup, SQL queries for inserting and retrieving
                data, and error handling for database operations.
                <br><br>
                I achieved Outcome 1 by organizing my code into separate files, making it more modular and easier to
                maintain. I also completed Outcome 4 by fully integrating MySQL with C++ and expanding database
                interactions, including reading and adding financial values in a row. Additionally, I achieved Outcome 5
                by implementing security measures such as input validation and password protection, ensuring the system
                is more secure and protected against vulnerabilities.
                <br><br>
                While improving the artifact, I learned how to connect a C++ program to MySQL, execute SQL queries and
                handle database errors properly. One challenge I faced was ensuring the database connection was stable
                and handling errors correctly. Another challenge was structuring SQL queries efficiently so that data
                could be retrieved and stored quickly. I also realized the importance of security in database
                applications and plan to add more security features to protect user information.</p>
