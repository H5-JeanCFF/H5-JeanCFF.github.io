            <p>My name is Jean Farfan, and I have been studying Computer Science for about two years. Before that, I had
                experience in Information Systems in my home country, Ecuador. Throughout my studies, I have learned
                about different areas of computer science, including software engineering, UI/UX design and secure
                coding. I have also gained experience in testing software to ensure reliability and efficiency.
                <br><br>
                My main focus is back-end development, where I work with programming languages like C++, Java and Python. I
                enjoy solving complex problems and making software secure and efficient. My goal is to become a back-end
                software engineer, creating reliable and scalable solutions while following best practices in security
                and performance.<br><br>Throughout this course and the Computer Science program, I have strengthened
                my technical skills and gained experience in software development. I have enhanced
                different artifacts in three different categories, each demonstrating my
                ability to apply key computer science concepts. By improving software design and
                security, optimizing algorithms and data structures, and implementing database
                management, I have shown my ability to create efficient, well-structured and
                secure applications. These enhancements reflect my skills in secure coding practices
                and problem-solving using advanced data structures.<br><br>One of my biggest
                accomplishments is learning how to write cleaner and maintainable code while
                ensuring efficiency and security. The enhancements I made demonstrate my ability to
                apply industry-standard practices, making my projects more reliable.<br><br>This
                experience has prepared me for the professional world by reinforcing my ability to
                design and implement technical solutions. Whether improving existing software or
                developing new applications, I have the knowledge and skills to build effective and
                reliable systems. My work in this course serves as proof of my ability to overcome
                challenges and continuously improve my technical skills.</p>

                    introducing a linked stack for inventory management. These improvements enhance
                    the game's efficiency, organization and maintainability, making it more adaptable
                    for future expansions.</p>
