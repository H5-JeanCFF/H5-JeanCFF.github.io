            <p><b>About Me</b><br>
                My name is Jean Farfan, and I have been studying Computer Science at Southern New Hampshire University
                for about two years. Before that, I had
                experience in Information Systems in my home country, Ecuador. Throughout my studies, I have learned
                about different areas of computer science, including software engineering, UI/UX design and secure
                coding. I have also gained experience in testing software to ensure reliability and efficiency.
                <br><br>
                My main focus is back-end development, where I work with programming languages like C++, Java and
                Python. I enjoy solving complex problems and making software secure and efficient. My goal is to become a back-end
                software engineer, creating reliable and scalable solutions while following best practices in security
                and performance.<br><br>
                <b>My Computer Science Knowledge and Skills</b><br>
                Throughout this course and the Computer Science program, I have strengthened
                my technical skills and gained experience in software development. I have enhanced
                different artifacts in three different categories, each demonstrating my
                ability to apply key computer science concepts. By improving software design and
                security, optimizing algorithms and data structures, and implementing database
                management, I have shown my <b>ability to create efficient, well-structured and
                secure applications</b>. These enhancements reflect my skills in secure coding practices
                and problem-solving using data structures.<br><br>My coursework has helped me develop
                <b>collaboration skills</b> by working on projects that required teamwork and version control. In past courses,
                I worked in a team environment using GitHub for version control. These
                experiences have prepared me to work effectively in professional software development teams.<br><br>
                Additionally, I have improved my communication skills by documenting my projects clearly and presenting
                my work to different audiences. Effective communication is essential in
                software engineering, whether it is <b>explaining technical concepts</b> to stakeholders, <b>writing documentation</b>
                for developers or providing user-friendly reports.<br><br>
                My coursework has also reinforced my knowledge of data structures and algorithms. In my projects, I have
                <b>worked with arrays, linked lists, and object-oriented programming (OOP)</b> to design and optimize
                solutions. These skills were further refined when I implemented graph-based navigation and stack-based
                inventory management in my text-based game enhancement.<br><br>
                Another key aspect of my learning has been software security. In CS 405: Secure Coding, I learned
                <b>security best practices</b>, such as input validation, exception handling and preventing overflow/underflow
                errors. These principles guided my enhancements to the Airgead Banking App (Category 1 and 3), where I
                implemented security
                improvements to <b>prevent vulnerabilities</b> and ensure reliable financial calculations.<br><br>
                Finally, working with databases has improved my understanding of data management. In
                my coursework, I worked on <b>designing and implementing structured databases to store, retrieve and
                manage data securely</b>. This experience helped me successfully implement a MySQL database for the Airgead
                Banking App, allowing for secure data storage and retrieval.<br><br>One of my biggest
                accomplishments is learning how to write cleaner and more maintainable code while
                ensuring efficiency and security. The enhancements I made demonstrate my ability to
                apply industry-standard practices, making my projects more reliable.<br><br>This
                experience has prepared me for the professional world by reinforcing my ability to
                design and implement technical solutions.
